% Predictive Talent Mobility, also known as PTM is a initiative by the Bussiness Analytics and Mathematics Science group to give a demonstration of the Predictive Analysis involved in Recruitment of a candidate for a job. There are three views namely Employee view, Hiring Manager View and HR Manager View. Depending on the type of role a person logins into the web Application and looks for the various data. For e.g. A Employee get to look at all the jobs he can apply or applied. A Hiring Manager can see the number of candidates who have applied for the job and finally, HR Manager can have a complete view of all the Jobs and the Candidates with the necessary analytics to have a better view of the project. This also includes integration of d3 technology in web-application. This project is externally available.

submodular maximization problem, and discovered that the submodular function turns out to be non-negative and non-montone.
\item Here, we used Submodular maximizartion by simulated annealing for this problem to obtain a 0.41-approximation
%\item Using the submodular structure helped in posing skill as soft requirement. We used Jaccard distance to measure the social compataility of two individuals on the given 
Social graph created from DBLP Dataset.

% This thesis is a composition of the various challenges encountered in making the leptonica library available to Scilab. The thesis is also a extension of the work done in Google summer of Code 2012 with the Organisation Scilab. This involved writing intermediate functions which form the fundamental background for working of both the different data-structures in scilab and leptonica. The library was made available to Scilab using siptoolbox. It also, involved making available two important leptonica functions in Scilab such as deskew and dewarp. The example functions were extensively tested on all types of images.
